This blog is for privacy and security information. At the moment, I do recommend checking the sources in the blog instead of relying completely on the writing and interpretation itself. The first series on here is the "Notes on GrapheneOS" series, which talks about the privacy and security enhancements in GrapheneOS. See the about page in the "Notes on GrapheneOS" folder to know more.
