This blog is for privacy and security information. At the moment, I do recommend checking the sources in the blog instead of relying completely on the writing and interpretation itself. The first series on here is the ["Notes on GrapheneOS"](https://github.com/Lelmister101/blog/blob/main/Notes%20on%20GrapheneOS%20intro.md) series, which talks about the privacy and security enhancements in GrapheneOS. See the introduction page to know more.
